# Rust Chapter 2

I worked through this a while back using the interactive Rust Book found [here](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)

This is pretty close to the same as the book directs except that I took a few liberties: 

1. Minor tweak to the output
    - Directed user to Ctrl-C to quit
    - Directed user to enter between 1-100
2. Added error messaging when user enters something other than a number
3. Added check for number to be between 1 and 100
4. Added a incrementer to track the number the user makes

Overall this is still a super simple program, but it's a fun introduction to using Rust and some of its conventions

I found it most interesting that they immediately introduce `match` statements but not `if` control statements

hmu :call_me_hand: if you wanna chat about how [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is so darn cool!
